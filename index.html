          <p><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p>
          <p>Hello! My name is Vladyslav!
              I like to study and work in the field of physics, especially medical physics,
              to develop small applications for Android, which somewhat simplify the routine
              part of my life and help me to win precious time for learning. Of course, I'm also
              developing as individual and gaining the skills required for career growth
              and achieving goals. The most up-to-date and useful things that I am finally
              going to do are to improve my English skills and Arduino microcontroller
              programming. I hope that sooner or later there will be an idea with which
              I will be able to assemble a team and establish business in the field of health care.</p>

          <p><b>TIMELINE</b></p>
          <p>2018:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>In January, I began to get back into shape after the New Year (running, pulling up, etc).</li>
            <li>I moved to a new level of self-management. Now I can combine the active study of physics, 
              the work of the project manager, studying programming and sports. It's hard, but it can not be excuse.</li>
            <li>Lessons at the Business-Leader School KNU have been resumed.</li>
            <li>I started working with a team of physicists and physiologists in the field of medical physics.</li>
            <li>Rest in Lviv.</li>
            <li><em>To be continued</em></li>
          </ul>

          <p>2017:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>At the beginning of the year, I started working as a project manager at Vents.</li>
            <li>I have completed a bachelor's degree in Physics from Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv.</li>
            <li>Entrance to the master's degree in theoretical physics on the same Faculty of Physics Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv.</li>
            <li>I entered into the team of organizers of Business-Leader School KNU.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>2016:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Our team led by Science Park Kyiv Taras Shevchenko University organized a startup battle between the teams of two universities 
              (Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv vs National Technical University of Ukraine "Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute").</li>
              <li>The second Startup-Business School was also organized by our team as a part of the StartUp-Business Incubator KNU project.</li>
              <li>I began to actively study programming.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>2015:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>I became interested in business and startups.</li>
            <li>I joined to the StartUp-Business Incubator KNU team.</li>
            <li>I led the organization of the first Startup-Business School within the framework of the StartUp-Business Incubator KNU project.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Until 2015:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>I am evolving myself in the areas of physics, mathematics and chemistry.</li>
          </ul>

            <p><b>SKILLS</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>C#</li>
              <li>A little C++</li>
              <li>A little HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>

          <p><b>Something about me:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>I like exact sciences, in particular physics, mathematics and chemistry.
                I'm professionally engaged in physics and I couldn't do it without math.
                But there is not enough time for chemistry.
                Apart from the study of the structure of atoms and molecules from
                the point of view of quantum mechanics, then perhaps the last thing
                I did in chemistry - watched the Breaking Bad series.</li>
            <li>Like many people, I like psychology.
                But I went further and now I'm studying physiology.
                Do not even ask me why do I need it...</li>
            <li>Like C #. I can tolerate Java (honestly!).
                The last statement is proved in practice, because somehow
                I read a book on Java programming for Android,
                but I codded in C # (Xamarin).
                Do not ask me why I did it ...
                The most surprising thing is that I liked it.</li>
            <li>I plan to study the programming of microcontrollers Arduino
                and finally master the electronics.</li>
